### Description

Budget is divided into different spending categories and limits spending to the allocated amount for each category. This system helps users manage their finances, prevents overspending, and promotes healthier spending habits. Itâ€™s a modern tool for personal finance management, suitable for anyone looking to gain better control over their finances.

It's a Node/Express API, all data is persisted in a database using PostgreSQL.
